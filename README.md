# Redux - Reselect

Simple “selector” library for Redux (and others) inspired by getters in NuclearJS, subscriptions in re-frame and this proposal from speedskater.

Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

# Redux - Persist

Persist and rehydrate a redux store.
